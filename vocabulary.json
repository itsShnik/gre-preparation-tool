The early Latin bassus, which meant \"thick, low,\" evolved into the Old French abaissier, meaning \"to make lower in value or status.\" The important clue to the word is \"base.\" Consider that the base of anything is the bottom, and you get an idea as to the meaning of the word abase, which means to make someone feel low.", "synonyms": "chagrin, humble, humiliate, mortify", "definition": "cause to feel shame"}, "abeyance": {"short_explanation": "An abeyance is a temporary halt to something, with the emphasis on \"temporary.\" It is usually used with the word \"in\" or \"into\"; \"in abeyance\" suggests a state of waiting or holding.", "long_explanation": "The word abeyance has a legal ring to it, and for a good reason \u00e2\u20ac\u201d appearing in English in the 16th century, it comes from the Anglo-French word abeiance, a legal term for waiting or hoping to receive property.

Now it might refer to either a literal chasm or a figurative one: \"Thirty years ago, we peered into this abyss and pulled back just in time.\" The word is sometimes used to describe a wide difference between cultures or nations.

The speaker is delivering what is known as a eulogy. A eulogy is a formal speech that praises a person who has died.", "long_explanation": "Usually a eulogy makes the dead person sound a lot more impressive than they really were. A couple of less common synonyms for this kind of \"praise the dead\" speech are panegyric and encomium. Sometimes the dead person was so unimpressive that there's nothing nice to say. And sometimes they were so awful that the only appropriate speech is a dyslogy that describes their faults and failings.", "synonyms": "eulogium", "definition": "a formal expression of praise for someone who has died"}, "exacerbate": {"short_explanation": "For a formal-sounding verb that means to make worse, try exacerbate. If you're in trouble, complaining about it will only exacerbate the problem.", "long_explanation": "Exacerbate is related to the adjective acrid, often used to describe sharp-smelling smoke. Think of exacerbate then as a sharp or bitter thing that makes something worse. A drought will exacerbate a country's food shortage.

If you've been wrongly accused of robbery, you'd better hope a judge will exculpate you, unless you want to go to jail because you've heard prison food is amazing.", "long_explanation": "Exculpate comes from two Latin words: ex-, meaning \"from,\" and culpa, meaning \"blame.\" Exculpate is similar in meaning to exonerate. When you exonerate someone, you clear a person of an accusation and any suspicion that goes along with it. Exculpate usually refers more directly to clearing the charges against someone. So if that judge exculpates you from the robbery charge, everyone in town might still think you did it.

When you make an extrapolation, you take facts and observations about a present or known situation and use them to make a prediction about what might eventually happen.", "long_explanation": "Extrapolation comes from the word extra, meaning \u201coutside,\u201d and a shortened form of the word interpolation. Interpolation might sound like a made-up word, but it\u2019s not. An interpolation is an insertion between two points. So an extrapolation is an insertion outside any existing points.

Predictions that the whole state of California will snap off from the rest of North America and float away have proven to be fallacious \u2014 for now, anyway.", "long_explanation": "Fallacious comes ultimately from the Latin fallax, \"deceptive.\" The word fallacious might describe an intentional deception or a false conclusion coming from bad science or incomplete understanding.

Hopefully all the time you're spending studying vocabulary won't turn out to be futile!", "long_explanation": "Futile comes from the Latin futilis, which originally meant \"leaky.\" Although we use futile to talk about more than buckets, the image of a leaky vessel is a good illustration of the adjective. Pouring water into a leaky bucket is futile.  Your exercise program will be futile if you don't stop chowing down on chocolate. Futile is fancier than its synonym useless.
